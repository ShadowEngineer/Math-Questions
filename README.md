# Year 13 Programming Project
## Pseudorandom Mathematics Revision Question Generator
Generates mathematics questions from selectable topics and gets you to answer them. In its simplest form, that's what it is and does.
It is designed and programmed in `Java`, utilising the `Javax.Swing` API.

It can also be configured to generate topics with bias towards the ones you answer more incorrect answers on.

You can choose the interface colours and even an optional background image.
It displays historical performance data by graphs and suggests you topics of improvement too.

Simple, yet effective.

## Publicity Notice
The original repository for this project with the entire version history is private on my profile since it contains some private information.
I have removed this information along with some other directories to only contain the documentation, the [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project with all the code (the real meat of this repository) and other needed files.
